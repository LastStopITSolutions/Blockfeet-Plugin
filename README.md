Blockfeet Plugin for Minecraft 1.20.x (Ignore the name. I couldn't think of anything else to name it.)

This is a simple plugin that allows any block a player mines to fall directly at the players feet, allowing them to pick it up without having to go and retrieve it.

Tested only on paper 1.20.4 and it works fine.

Compiled jar of the plugin is located in /target

Feel free to fork it and add compatibility for other mc server versions. I'm also accepting input on what should be changed or added.
